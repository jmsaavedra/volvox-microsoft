# /_raw-images
---

This folder will hold the raw images downloaded from Azure File Storage.

We do this because all of the image processing needs to happen locally on this machine.

After a day has been successfully processed, these files will be deleted from the machine, meaning that this folder should be empty unless we are currently processing a day of video (around 9pm every weeknight).
